## 1. Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | In Practice |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Professional but approachable** | Expert without being condescending | Use "you" and "we," not "the client" or "the user" |
| **Technical but accessible** | Explain complexity without dumbing it down | Lead with benefits, follow with technical depth for those who want it |
| **Confident but humble** | Know our stuff, don't brag about it | Show expertise through examples, not superlatives |
| **Direct but warm** | Get to the point, but be human | Short sentences, active voice, genuine enthusiasm |

### Tone Guidelines

**DO:**
- Write like you're explaining to a smart friend over coffee
- Use contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
- Start sentences with "And," "But," or "So" when it flows naturally
- Use humor sparingly and appropriately
- Lead with the outcome, then explain the how

**DON'T:**
- Use corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, holistic)
- Overpromise or use hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Talk down to the reader
- Use passive voice ("it was determined that...")
- Write walls of text without breaks

### The "Complexity → Benefits" Framework

Every piece of content should follow this structure:

1. **Acknowledge the complexity** (show we understand the problem)
2. **Explain what we do** (the solution, briefly)
3. **Lead with benefits** (what they get, not how it works)
4. **Offer the details** (for those who want to go deeper)

**Example:**
> ❌ "We implement OpenClaw gateway infrastructure to enable automated agent orchestration."
>
> ✅ "Your AI assistant works 24/7—handling research, drafting emails, and keeping projects moving. The technical setup? That's my job."

## 2. Key Messaging Framework

### Primary Value Proposition

**"The Executive's AI Assistant"**

You didn't hire an AI expert. But you need AI to work for you.
I build AI systems that handle the work you'd need a full-time assistant to do—without the hiring, training, or management overhead.

### Secondary Message

**"I stay on top of AI so you don't have to"**

New tools drop daily. OpenClaw updates. Claude releases. Perplexity adds features.
You have a business to run. I make sure your AI systems keep getting better without you lifting a finger.

### Proof Points

| Proof Point | How We Demonstrate It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Speed** | "Most setups complete in 1-2 weeks" / "Your first workflow running in days, not months" |
| **Customization** | "Built for your specific tools and workflows" / "Not templates—tailored systems" |
| **Ongoing Support** | "I don't disappear after launch" / "Monthly optimization included" / "Slack access for quick questions" |

### Messaging by Context

**Homepage/Hero:**
- Lead with the transformation (what life looks like after)
- Secondary: What we actually do
- Proof: Speed + results

**Service Pages:**
- Lead with the specific problem this service solves
- Secondary: How it works (briefly)
- Proof: Concrete examples/outcomes

**Pricing:**
- Lead with the business outcome
- Secondary: What's included
- Proof: ROI framing, comparison to hiring

**Pain Points:**
- Too many meetings, not enough time for deep work
- Administrative tasks eating into strategic thinking time

- Scale their personal impact without scaling their hours

**Messaging That Resonates:**
- "Get an assistant without the hiring headache"
- "Your AI works while you sleep"
- "Focus on strategy, let AI handle the rest"
- "Built for executives, not engineers"

**Objections & Responses:**
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't have time to learn a new system" | "The system learns you. I handle the setup—you just start delegating." |
| "What about security?" | "Your data never leaves your infrastructure. Full privacy, full control." |
| "This sounds expensive" | "Less than a part-time EA, works 24/7, and scales as you grow." |

---

### SMB Owner Persona: "Wearing All The Hats"

**Profile:**
- **Title:** Founder, Owner, Managing Partner
- **Company:** 5-25 employees

**Pain Points:**

- "Set it up once, it runs forever"

**Objections & Responses:**

| "What if it breaks?" | "Ongoing support is included. I monitor, optimize, and fix—so you don't have to think about it." |
| "I'm not technical enough" | "You don't need to be. I speak business, not just code." |

## 5. Content Sections Guide

### Hero Section

**Purpose:** Immediately communicate value and drive to primary CTA

**Key Messages (in order of importance):**
1. **The Transformation:** "Get an AI assistant that actually works"
2. **The Problem We Solve:** "Stop drowning in admin work"
3. **The Differentiator:** "Custom-built for you, not a template"

**Headline Formulas:**
- "The Executive's AI Assistant"
- "Your AI-Powered Second Brain"
- "Finally, AI That Works For You"
- "Stop Managing. Start Delegating."

**Subheadline Guidelines:**
- One sentence that explains what we do
- Focus on the outcome, not the technology
- Include the word "you" or "your"

**CTA Hierarchy:**
| Priority | CTA | Button Text |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Book consultation | "Book a Call" / "Let's Talk" |
| 2 | Take assessment | "Find Your Solution" |
| 3 | View services | "See How It Works" |

**Hero Do's and Don'ts:**
- **DO:** Lead with the benefit, follow with the method
- **DO:** Use active, present-tense language
- **DO:** Include a social proof element (logos, testimonial, or "trusted by...")
- **DON'T:** Use technical jargon in the headline
- **DON'T:** Make the CTA button too small or unclear
- **DON'T:** Try to explain everything in the hero

---

### Workflows Section

**Purpose:** Show the depth and sophistication of what we build

**Content Approach:**
This section should demonstrate that we don't just set up tools—we design sophisticated systems. Think of it as showing the "wiring behind the walls."

**Structure for Each Workflow Example:**

1. **The Scenario** (1-2 sentences)
   - Set the scene: "You're preparing for a board meeting..."

2. **The Workflow** (Visual or step-by-step)
   - Show the agent hierarchy
   - Show the trigger → action flow
   - Use simple diagrams, not code

3. **The Result** (1 sentence)
   - Quantify the outcome: "You walk in with a 12-page briefing that took zero of your time"

**Example Workflow: "The Morning Brief"**

```
Trigger: 7:00 AM daily
↓
Research Agent → Scans news, competitors, industry updates
↓
Email Agent → Summarizes overnight emails, flags urgent items
↓
Calendar Agent → Reviews today's meetings, preps briefs for each
↓
Output: Single-page briefing delivered to your inbox by 7:30 AM
```

**Another Example: "The Deal Flow Assistant"**

```
Trigger: New company enters CRM
↓
Research Agent → Pulls company info, funding, competitors
↓
Analysis Agent → Scores opportunity against your criteria
↓
Notification Agent → Alerts you with summary + recommendation
↓
Follow-up Agent → Drafts personalized outreach email
```

**Tone Notes:**
- Show complexity, but explain it simply
- Use visual diagrams when possible
- Include time savings for each workflow
- Make it feel attainable, not aspirational

Before publishing any content, check:
- [ ] Did I lead with benefits, not features?
- [ ] Is the tone conversational, not corporate?
- [ ] Did I use "you" more than "we" or "I"?
- [ ] Is there a clear next step (CTA)?
- [ ] Would a busy executive understand this immediately?

### Content Review Questions

For blog posts:
- [ ] Does this solve a real problem our personas have?
- [ ] Is the headline specific and compelling?
- [ ] Are there clear subheadings for scanning?
- [ ] Did I include at least one CTA?
- [ ] Is there a concrete takeaway or action item?

For service pages:
- [ ] Is the value proposition clear in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Did I address common objections?
- [ ] Are the outcomes specific and quantified where possible?
- [ ] Is the CTA prominent and compelling?

### A/B Testing Priorities

1. Hero headline variations
2. Primary CTA button text
3. Assessment vs. consultation as primary CTA
4. Short vs. long-form service descriptions
5. Testimonial placement and format
