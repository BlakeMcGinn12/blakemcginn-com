### Cold Email Sequence

**Email 1 (Day 1): The Pattern Interrupt**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]'s workflow

Hi [First Name],

I help business owners like you eliminate repetitive tasks using AI automation.

Most of my clients save 10+ hours/week by automating things like:
• Email triage and responses
• Calendar scheduling
• CRM updates
• Report generation

I built a quick assessment tool that shows exactly which tasks you should automate first (takes 2 minutes):

Worth a look?

Blake
P.S. I'm based in Chicago too - always happy to grab coffee if you're local.
```

**Email 2 (Day 3): The Social Proof**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company Name]'s workflow

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up - I recently helped a [similar company] owner save 12 hours/week by automating their client onboarding process.

The ROI was clear within the first week.

If repetitive tasks are eating your time, the assessment tool will show you the low-hanging fruit:

Best,
Blake

**Email 3 (Day 7): The Soft Close**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

I'm helping 2-3 business owners per month implement AI automation. If saving 10+ hours/week sounds interesting, here's my calendar:

If not, no worries - I'll close your file.

Best,
Blake
